/*
 * An extractor is an object that parses data in one buffer, selects
 * some of the data fields and writes them into a second output
 * buffer.  An extractor maintains a pointers into the data buffer
 * (from where the next byte will be read) and into the output buffer
 * (to where the next copied byte will be written).  Its method
 * functions perform all of the necessary bounds checking to ensure
 * that all of the reading and writing operations respect buffer
 * bounaries.  Some operations advance both the data and output
 * pointers, while others advance just the data pointer or just the
 * output pointer, and others advance neither.  
 * 
 * Some data formats require the parsing of a variable-length data
 * field, whose length is encoded in the data.  To facilitate this, a
 * second 'inner' extractor can be pushed on top of an extractor with
 * the extractor_push function, which initializes the inner extractor
 * to read from the data buffer defined by the variable-length field.
 * After the inner data has been read, a call to extractor_pop updates
 * the outer extractor appropriately.
 * 
 * For protocol fingerprinting, the data copied into the output buffer
 * should contain enough information that it can be parsed without the
 * help of any additional information.
