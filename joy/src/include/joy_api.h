/*
 * Function: joy_bd_external_processing
 *
 * Description: This function is allows the calling application of
 *      the Joy library to handle the processing of the flow records
 *      that have BD (byte distribution) information ready for export.
 *      This function simply goes through the flow records and invokes
 *      the callback function to process the records that have SPLT data.
 *
 *      Records that get processed have the BD processed flag updated
 *      but are NOT removed from the flow record list.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      index - index of the context to use
 *      min_octets - minimum number of octets processed before ready
 *      callback - function that actually does the flow record processing
 *
 * Returns:
 *      none
 *
 * Notes:
 *      The callback function will get passed a pointer to the flow record.
 *      The BD data needs to be preprocessed for export and as such, the
 *      data_len field will be the length of the preprocessed data and the
 *      data field will be a pointer to the actual preprocessed data. The callback
 *      does not need to worry about freeing the memory associated with the data.
 *      Once control returns from the callback function, the library will free that
 *      memory. IF the callback function needs access to this data after it returns
 *      control to the library, then it should copy that data for later use.
 *
 *      For NetFlow V9 and IPFix:
 *          The data length is always 512 bytes. Currently only BD format uncompressed
 *              is defined in the spec.
 *          The data format is a series of 16-bit values representing the count of a
 *              given ascii value. The first 16-bit value represents the number of
 *              times ascii value 0 was seen in the flow. The second 16-bit value
 *              represents the number times the ascii value 1 was seen in the flow.
 *              This continues for all ascii values up to value 255.
